## About The Project

LVL-UP was made, as a tool to help people improve their lives. We all have goals, and many of the times these goals consist of us taking on recurring tasks to improve ourselves. Such as working out, eating healthy, sleeping well, practicing a new hobby or sport or skill. LVL-UP gives users the ability to create goals, pick sponsors for their goals, and track their progress over a duration of time, this one is set to 30 days. 

As after 30 days we hope that the new habit has stuck. Also users can provide descriptions to their goals to remind themselves what exactly they were to do, and the sponsors are the added bonus. A nice incentive for hitting those daily goals over a period of time, where sponsors may offer up a deal or discount to reward their favorite customers on improving themselves. As self care, and treating one self becomes something that everyone would like to promote in the world, merchants may appreciate, that their product is a reward for their clients hardwork. 

I wanted to create a product I could see myself using, and who doesn't want to have tools that help them reach their goals.
